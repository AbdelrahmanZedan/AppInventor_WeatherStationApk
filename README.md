# Android weather station [application](https://goo.gl/xUc9Ft) by app inventor 

 # Overview
- This android application is for receiving data sent over bluetooth, from your microcontroller.
- You can run the app on any android device which has a bluetooth.
 - The APK is made by MIT app inventor which is simmilar to scratch as it uses units of blocks to build the application.
 - I've published my project to the app inventor gallery, so you could open the app either to view the blocks of the project or to download the apk from the app inventor gallery (after registration) from [here]( ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/?galleryId=6308018557550592).
 
 # Getting Started
 - You could download the apk directly without any registration from google drive [here](https://goo.gl/xUc9Ft).
 - Install the Apk on your desired android device.
 - Turn on BT before running the app or the app will notify you to turn it on :)
 - Touch or click the "Not Connected to a BT device" button and select your BT module.
 - Enjoy receiving your sensors readings or whatever you want over Bluetooth.
